# Verification Guide

How to check that everything deployed correctly.

## Step 1: Check ArgoCD First

**Start with ArgoCD** - this tells you if the GitOps setup worked:

If all previous steps went well, ArgoCD should be accessible at:
https://argocd.stack-ai.jesuspaz.com

**What to look for:**
- All applications should show "Synced" and "Healthy"
- No red errors or warnings
- Supabase application should be deployed successfully

**If ArgoCD looks good, everything else should work.** If there are issues here, fix them before testing the APIs.

## Step 2: Quick Infrastructure Check

```bash
# Make sure all pods are running
kubectl get pods -n supabase

# Should see all services in "Running" state
# If some are pending or crashing, check the logs
```

## Step 3: Test Supabase APIs

**Run the automated test suite:**

```bash
cd test/
make all

# Expected: âœ… Tests passed: 13-14/14 (93-100%)
```

**Access the dashboard:**
https://supabase.stack-ai.jesuspaz.com

## If Something Looks Wrong

### Check ArgoCD Status
```bash
# Look at application status
kubectl get applications -n argocd

# Check for sync errors
kubectl describe application supabase -n argocd
```

### Basic Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check pod logs if something isn't working
kubectl logs -n supabase -l app.kubernetes.io/name=supabase-auth

# Verify secrets are syncing
kubectl get externalsecrets -n supabase

# Make sure RDS is accessible
kubectl get pods -n supabase
```

## What Success Looks Like

**ArgoCD dashboard:**
- All applications "Synced" and "Healthy"
- No red errors or warnings

**Supabase dashboard:**
- https://supabase.stack-ai.jesuspaz.com loads correctly
- Can navigate between Auth, Storage, and other sections

**Test results:**
- 13-14/14 API tests passing
- Core services (Auth, PostgREST, Storage) working
- Minor issues with Realtime are expected

**That's it** - if ArgoCD is happy and the test suite mostly passes, everything is working correctly.
