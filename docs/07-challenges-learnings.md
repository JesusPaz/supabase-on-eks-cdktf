# Challenges & Learnings

## Main Challenge: Database Integration

**The straightforward path:** Use Supabase's included PostgreSQL pod - works perfectly out of the box.

**The challenge I took on:** Make Supabase work with external RDS for production use.

### What Made It Difficult

**Database setup was the main hurdle:**
- Figuring out which PostgreSQL extensions Supabase needs (pg_tle, pgsodium)
- Setting up RDS parameter groups and handling instance reboots
- Creating the right database users and permissions
- Building a Lambda migration pipeline to handle all the setup

**Service integration took time:**
- Getting JWT tokens working across all services
- Configuring Realtime with proper tenant setup
- Connecting each service to the external database correctly

### What Worked Well

**Standard DevOps stuff was straightforward:**
- AWS infrastructure with CDKTF
- Kubernetes and Helm deployments
- ArgoCD and GitOps setup
- Basic networking and security

**Learning approach:** Studied the [supabase-on-aws](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-on-aws) community implementation to understand the migration patterns.

## Current Status & Time Constraints

### What's Working
- ✅ **Core functionality** - Auth, PostgREST, Storage working perfectly
- ✅ **Infrastructure** - All AWS resources deployed and functional
- ✅ **Testing** - 13/14 API tests passing (93% success rate)

### What Needs More Time
- ⚠️ **Studio dashboard** - Some Meta service connectivity issues
- ⚠️ **Realtime** - Minor authentication problems
- ⚠️ **Analytics** - Temporarily disabled due to CDC complexity

### Time Reality
**2-3 day timeline with full-time job** made it challenging to perfect every detail. With a few more hours of trial and error, could get everything 100% functional. The core challenge was solved - **Supabase successfully running on external RDS** - which was the main technical hurdle.

## Key Learnings

### Enterprise Integration Complexity
**Core challenge:** Making Supabase work with production RDS instead of included PostgreSQL pod.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- **System integration** - Connecting complex services to external dependencies
- **Migration engineering** - Custom Lambda pipeline for database setup
- **Service architecture** - Multi-service coordination and configuration
- **Production adaptation** - Enterprise requirements vs development defaults

### Problem-Solving Approach
**Systematic methodology:**
1. **Community research** - Studied [supabase-on-aws](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-on-aws) patterns
2. **Log-driven debugging** - Service logs revealed configuration requirements
3. **Iterative testing** - Incremental fixes and validation
4. **Documentation creation** - Comprehensive testing and verification

**Result:** Successfully adapted open-source application for enterprise production environment with external managed services.
